MINI PURCHASE CRUD USING EJS
This is a small project to refresh concepts that I have forgotten during
the time, in this case I'm using ejs and express to create a fullstack 
application with embebed Javascript.

The database was created using MySQL, but instead of working with raw
SQL inside my Javascript code I use the ORM sequelize to speed up
the process of creating tables.
